# NU-aly6015-Ames-housing-final-project

Real estate is an ever-changing, fast-paced industry. As new real estate investors in the Ames, Iowa community in 2011, we have limited market experience in this region and need help familiarizing ourselves with the local market. Our objective is to utilize the Ames Housing data set of recent home purchases in Ames from 2006-2010 to give us guidance for which properties to purchase or sell (De Cock 2011). This analysis with look at a smaller aspect each of three major themes in real estate: 1- Features; 2- Location; and 3- Size.

1- Features- we will look at if the varying types of basements impact the sale price of a property using the Kruskal-Wallis test.

2- Location- we will look at if there is a meaningful difference in the average sale price of a property in 3 target neighborhoods using the Kruskal-Wallis test.

3- Size- we will look at how accurately we can predict the sale price of a property with only predictor variables of size (like square footage and room counts). We will use LASSO and Ridge regressions to compare the best fitting model.
